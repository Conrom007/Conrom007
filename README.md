- 👋 Hi, I’m @Conrom007 and I'm a Postgraduate Data Science student (MSc Data Science).
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science, specifically ML/AI, and their application in Bioinformatics and other fields. I have various levels of self-taught coding experience and I have a STEM background from school and self study. I also have a BSc in Finance with Advanced Math and Statistics modules and as a result I have Industry experience.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Data Science while slowly planning to start incorporating more and more data from Bio. & Med. studies.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on various Data Science and, in the near future, Bioinformatics projects to gain experience and establish a Portfolio.
- 📫 To reach me email me at: conrom007@gmail.com .
